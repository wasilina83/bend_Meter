# Bend Meter with Mediapipe and OpenCV

## Introduction
The "Bend Meter" is a Python program that utilizes the Mediapipe and OpenCV libraries to monitor the real-time angle of the arm and visualize it. This code allows capturing arm movements and displaying the bending angle on the screen, along with a display of the current "Bend Meter" status calculated based on the angle.

## Prerequisites
Before running the code, you need to install the following libraries:

```bash
!pip install mediapipe opencv-python
```

## Code Overview
The code is divided into various sections to explain its functionality and workflow:

### Section 1: Initialization and Capturing the Video Stream
In this section, the video stream from a webcam (camera with ID 1) is captured and displayed. When the "q" key is pressed, the loop exits, the video stream is released, and the window is closed.

### Section 2: Mediapipe Initialization and Pose Detection
Here, the Mediapipe library is used to detect the user's pose. The captured video frame is converted to RGB format, the pose is detected, and the results are stored in a variable called "results."

### Section 3: Extracting Landmarks and Calculating the Bending Angle
In this section, the detected landmarks (positions of joints and body parts) are extracted from the Mediapipe results. The bending angle of the arm is calculated using the extracted landmarks.

### Section 4: Visualizing the Bending Angle and Bend Meter Status
The bending angle is visualized on the screen above the hip joint. Additionally, the Bend Meter status is calculated and displayed based on the bending angle. There are four possible statuses: "slightly_formal," "respekt_full," "profound_respecct_or_regret," and "begging_for_your_life." The statuses are updated according to the bending angle.

### Section 5: Rendering and Display
The detected pose landmarks are displayed on the video frame, and the updated frame is shown on the screen. The loop continues until the "q" key is pressed.

## Additional Functions
The code includes two additional functions:
- `calculate_angle(a, b, c)`: This function calculates the angle between three points a, b, and c.
- `calculate_bend_angle(angle)`: This function calculates the bending angle based on the angle between the shoulder, hip, and knee.

## Conclusion
The "Bend Meter" is a useful tool for monitoring the arm's bending angle in real-time. It can be used for various applications such as fitness tracking, yoga exercises, or rehabilitation. The code can be extended and customized to add more functionality or meet the requirements of your project.

Feel free to modify and enhance the code to suit your needs.
